Major Updates:
    1) movielist/ranking rendering logic for 2 already ranked items

    2) Actual changes to data based upon selection (updating .json files via redux actions)
        - or connecting to a database

Known Issues:
    - D lost to C and still has a higher rank (trying to go alphabetical)
    - F facing against A twice at the end. 
    - F facing D skipping vs C
    - E Facing A and B again (gives wins to everything prior to E appearing then if E wins or losses first fight and the opposite on the subsequent it'll reface its first opponent)



Possible Drag/Drop functionality for this sorted List

Comparison button/reranking = allows ranking changes between items that are already ranked.
