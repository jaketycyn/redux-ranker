Can search through api on instant change of text query.

Potential concerns:
- How data intensive will it be query searching on every letter change?
- Since the search is by keyword lots of titles without images are being shown - should we block those types of films from being rendered?
- Should there be some sort of wait between searches?
- Search bar functinality by popularity pulled from the api

Presentation improvements:
-Flipping of the itemGridCard to allow information such as release year, director, actors, etc to be displayed.
- Changing Search state from react to redux to allow redux-persist to save a user's search for when they switch between `ADD` and `RANK`


No known issues at this time!

- Item add function (tinder add to list function - feeling lucky?)
- Custom Prompt functions
- Changing button on add (statemanagement setItem toggle)
