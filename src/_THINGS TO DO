Sorted List component that allows people to see everything that is ranked and/or unranked.

Possible Drag/Drop functionality for this sorted List


Logic for how to pick/rank two objects that have already been 'ranked'





Comparison button/reranking = allows ranking changes between items that are already ranked. 









Ideas: 
    - Adding extra properites such as # of times ranked &/or matchups history to each item in array.
