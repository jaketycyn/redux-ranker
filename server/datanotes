How to structure data:

TABLE user (
UNQIEU ID
)

TABLE movies(
UNIQUE ID
)

TABLE user_list(
    foreign key to movie
    foreign key to user

    //constraint on the table so the value has to be unique for a particular user
)

//postgress is meant to be on a single machine. If for whatever reason you need to scale to multiple machines. It's infe ot have multiple instances ,b tu 1 master. YOu have have 100 slaves. All the updates happen on the master. It broadcasts that update to  all the other databses they listen for updates.
